# 6_services.sh: sets up supervisor to start the various worker processes, if any are configured. The tutorial example typically
# sets up a worker called "tutorial-pool", though you can have any number of them. To change these later, edit
# the supervisor configuration in /etc/vespene/ and restart the vespene systemd service.

# workers are coded so that if they don't have an object in the Vespene database yet those processes will sleep and wake
# up every minute until they do.  So if you created some named workers here you still need to create those names in the
# Vespene UI before they can start doing any work.
